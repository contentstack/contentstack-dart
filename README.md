Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/).

Contentstack provides Dart SDK to build application on top of Dart. Given below is the detailed guide and helpful resources to get started with our Dart SDK.


### Prerequisite

You will need Dart installed on your machine. You can install it from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

### Setup and Installation

To use the Contentstack Dart SDK to your existing project, perform the steps given below:

**Install Dart Package**

```
contentstack 0.1.0
```


### Key Concepts for using Contentstack

#### Stack

A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about [Stacks](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/stack).

#### Content Type

Content type lets you define the structure or blueprint of a page or a section of your digital property. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. [Read more](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-types).

#### Entry

An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. Learn more about [Entries](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-management#working-with-entries).

#### Asset

Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries. Read more about [Assets](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-management#working-with-assets).

#### Environment

A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. Learn how to work with [Environments](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/environments).



### Contentstack Dart SDK: 5-minute Quickstart

#### Initializing your SDK

To initialize the SDK, specify application  API key, access token, and environment name of the stack as shown in the snippet given below (config is optional):
```
Stack stack = Contentstack.stack(apiKey: 'api_key', accessToken: 'access_token', environment: 'environment');
```
To get the API credentials mentioned above, log in to your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings &gt; Stack to view the API Key and Access Token.



#### Querying content from your stack

To retrieve a single entry from a content type use the code snippet given below:

```
Entry entry = stack.contentType('content_type_uid').entry('uid');
result = entry.fetch();
```
##### Get Multiple Entries

To retrieve multiple entries of a particular content type, use the code snippet given below:

```
Entry entry = stack.contentType('content_type_uid').entries();
//Query by map
var query = {'key': 'value'}
result = query.find(query);
```


### Advanced Queries

You can query for content types, entries, assets and more using our Java API Reference.
